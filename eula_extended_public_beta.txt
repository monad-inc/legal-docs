Monad Public Beta - End User License Agreement (EULA)

Acceptance of Terms

This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a binding contract between Monad, Inc. ("Monad" or "we") and you, the end user of the Service. This Agreement applies whether you are an individual or you are using the Service on behalf of a company or other organization. By registering for, accessing, or using the Monad platform while in Public Beta (the "Service"), you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement, and "you" will refer to that organization as well as yourself as an individual user.



Beta Product Acknowledgment

Public Beta Status: You understand and acknowledge that the Service is provided as a public beta for evaluation and testing purposes only. The Service is still in development, may contain bugs, errors, or other issues, and is not at the level of performance or reliability of a commercially released, production-ready service. It is not intended or suited for use in a production environment. Features and functionality may be incomplete or undergo changes, and future releases may change the way the Service operates. Monad may update, modify, or discontinue the Beta Service (in whole or in part) at any time without notice as part of the testing and development process.

No SLA or Guaranteed Support: Because this Service is a beta release, Monad provides no service level agreement (SLA), uptime guarantee, or support commitment for the Service. Monad does not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects will be corrected. You accept that the Service may be unavailable at times, and that performance may be unpredictable. Any support provided by Monad is at Monad’s discretion on an as-available basis. You agree that you are using the Service for the purposes of testing and evaluation, and you assume all risks associated with such use.

Evaluation Use Only: You agree to use the Service solely for your own internal evaluation and non-production testing, or for any mission-critical purposes. You acknowledge that any outputs or results from the Service are for testing/evaluation only and should not be relied upon as accurate or complete for production decisions. Monad welcomes feedback during this beta period, but providing feedback is optional and at your discretion. Any feedback, suggestions, or ideas you do provide regarding the Service ("Feedback") is entirely voluntary, and you grant Monad a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate such Feedback into Monad’s products and services without any obligation to you.



License Grant and Authorized Use

Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Monad grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service during the beta period for the sole purpose of evaluating and testing the Service. This license is provided for your internal use only. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by Monad and its licensors. You acknowledge that the Service (including any software, algorithms, and documentation associated with it) is licensed, not sold, and that this Agreement does not grant you any title or ownership in the Service or underlying intellectual property.

Use Restrictions: You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities, and you will ensure that no third party does so on your behalf:

- No Misuse or External Service Use: Do not use the Service for any purpose other than the intended testing and evaluation of the Beta. For example, you will not use the Service as part of a commercial offering to third parties, or incorporate the Service into your own product or service for production use.   

- No Modification or Derivative Works: Do not copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of any part of the Service. You will not attempt to extract any source code or separate components of the Service unless expressly permitted by Monad.  

- No Reverse Engineering: Do not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the Service, except to the limited extent that applicable law expressly permits despite this restriction.  

- No Resale or Transfer: Do not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, or otherwise transfer the Service or any of your rights in the Service to any other person or entity. Your access is personal (or limited to your organization’s internal use) and may not be shared outside your organization.  

- Preserve Proprietary Notices: Do not remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices that appear within the Service or any output from the Service.  

- No Competitive Use: Do not use the Service to develop or enhance any product or service that competes with Monad, and do not exploit the Service for purposes of competitive benchmarking or analysis. While you may evaluate the Service’s performance for your own understanding, you agree not to publish or share benchmark results or other performance data regarding the Service without Monad’s prior written consent.  

- Legal Compliance: Do not use the Service in violation of any applicable law or regulation. This includes (but is not limited to) compliance with data privacy laws and export control laws. You will not export or re-export the Service or any related technology in violation of export control laws of applicable jurisdictions (including the United States, or other governments).  

- Security and Integrity: Do not attempt to bypass or undermine any security or authentication measures of the Service. You will not interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service (for example, by engaging in denial-of-service attacks, introducing malware, or attempting to access data of other users). Any penetration testing or vulnerability scanning of the Service is strictly prohibited without Monad’s explicit written consent.  

Monad reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these use restrictions or otherwise misuse the Service. Such suspension or termination may occur without notice and at Monad’s sole discretion.



Fees and Paid Tiers

Free and Paid Tiers: Monad offers a free Basic tier of the Service as well as two paid subscription tiers (with enhanced features or capacity). The Basic tier provides limited functionality at no charge. The paid tiers offer additional features or higher usage limits in exchange for a subscription fee. Details of each tier’s features and pricing are provided on the Monad website or within the Service interface. By selecting a paid tier, you agree to pay the applicable subscription fees and any associated taxes or charges as described in the sign-up process or documentation.

Payment Processing: All payments for the Service’s paid tiers are handled through a third-party payment processor, Stripe. Monad does not collect, process, or store your credit card information or other payment details on its own servers. Any payment information you provide is submitted directly to Stripe via secure, client-side Stripe libraries (e.g. Stripe.js). No payment data passes through or is retained on Monad’s backend systems. By signing up for a paid tier, you authorize Stripe to charge your provided payment method for the recurring subscription fees applicable to your chosen tier. You are responsible for reviewing and agreeing to Stripe’s terms of service and privacy policy, which govern Stripe’s handling of your payment information and any recurring charges. Monad is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or security incidents on the part of Stripe in processing payments.

Recurring Payments: Paid tier subscriptions are typically billed on a recurring basis (e.g. monthly or annually, depending on your plan). You are responsible for understanding how and when Stripe will charge your payment method for recurring fees. It is your obligation to manage your subscription, including updating your payment information as needed and cancelling if you do not wish to renew. If you want to stop a paid subscription from renewing, you must cancel the subscription through the Service interface or via the process provided (which may involve managing your billing through Stripe’s portal). Cancelling near the renewal date might result in the next charge being processed if not done in time, and Monad will not be liable for charges incurred due to your delay in cancellation.

Overage Charges for Data Usage: Some subscription tiers include data volume limits. If you exceed your plan’s allocation, Monad may automatically charge your payment method for overage usage at the then-current rate listed on our pricing page or in your account.

By using the Service beyond your included limits, you consent to these overage charges without the need for separate authorization. You are responsible for monitoring your usage and understanding your plan’s limits. While Monad may send usage alerts, we are not obligated to do so.

To avoid overage fees, please upgrade your plan or manage your data usage accordingly.

Failed Payments: If a recurring payment cannot be processed (for example, due to an expired credit card, insufficient funds, or any other issue), Monad may suspend your paid Service features or downgrade your account to the free tier until payment is successfully made. You are responsible for any amounts that remain unpaid and for providing a valid payment method to rectify the failed payment. Monad is not liable for any loss of data or functionality you may experience due to suspension or downgrading that results from failed payments.

Upgrades and Downgrades: You may upgrade or downgrade your subscription tier if your needs change, subject to the options Monad makes available. Changing tiers may adjust the features accessible to you and will adjust your fees accordingly. For example, upgrading to a higher tier may result in a prorated charge for the remainder of the current billing period, and downgrading may take effect at the next billing cycle. Be aware that downgrading to the free tier or a lower tier may result in the loss of features or capacity. Data or configurations that depend on higher-tier features might become inaccessible or altered when you downgrade or cancel a paid subscription.

No Refunds: Subscription fees (and any other charges) paid to Monad are non-refundable to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless Monad explicitly states otherwise. This means that if you cancel in the middle of a billing period, you will typically not receive a refund for the unused portion of that period. If you believe there has been a billing error or you have extraordinary circumstances, you should contact Monad support (or Stripe, as appropriate) to discuss the issue, but Monad makes no guarantee of refund. Monad reserves the right to change the pricing for any Service tier (free or paid) in the future; if pricing changes, Monad will provide advance notice (for example, by email or within the Service), and the new prices will apply only to subsequent billing cycles or new subscriptions – your existing subscription will not be charged retroactively at a new rate during its current term.



User Data and Privacy

User Log Data Handling: The Service is designed to extract and transfer security log data (or other data you configure) from your systems or third-party sources to a destination of your choice (such as a data warehouse, SIEM, or storage service). You retain ownership of all data (including logs and other content) that you or your systems provide to Monad through the Service ("User Data"). Monad does not claim any ownership rights in your User Data. Except for the temporary processing and caching necessary to provide the Service, Monad does not store or retain your log data after it has been delivered to your designated destination. In practice, this means once the Service successfully delivers your data to the target system you’ve configured, Monad’s platform will promptly purge or delete any transient copies of that data from its systems. Monad will not use your log data for any purpose other than to provide the Service, troubleshoot issues, or improve the Service’s performance (and any such use for improvement would only be in an aggregated or anonymized manner, without disclosing your specific data).

API Credentials: To use the Service, you may need to provide Monad with access credentials (such as API keys, tokens, or usernames/passwords) for the systems from which the Service will retrieve data or to which it will deliver data. You are responsible for ensuring you have the right to provide these credentials and that doing so does not violate any third-party terms or policies. Monad will store your API credentials securely, for example by encrypting them at rest and restricting access, and will use them only for the purpose of performing the data extraction/loading functions on your behalf. Monad will not share your API credentials with unauthorized parties, and Monad’s personnel will only access them if necessary to assist with a support issue or to maintain the Service. However, you understand that you are ultimately responsible for safeguarding your own authentication credentials for third-party services. If you suspect that any of your API credentials stored with Monad have been compromised, you should revoke/change those credentials immediately and notify Monad so appropriate measures can be taken.

Personal Information and Privacy: When you sign up for or use the Service, Monad may collect certain personal information about you or your users (such as names, email addresses, and contact details) as part of account registration or in the course of providing support. Monad will handle any personal information it collects in accordance with applicable privacy laws and its published Privacy Policy (if one is provided on the Monad website). No payment information (like credit card numbers) is collected by Monad, as all payments are handled by Stripe as described above. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information about you by Monad in accordance with the Privacy Policy. If you have questions about how your data is handled, please review the Privacy Policy or contact Monad. You also acknowledge that when you provide personal or financial information to Stripe for payment, that information is governed by Stripe’s privacy policy, not Monad’s, and Monad is not responsible for Stripe’s handling of your information.

Data Security: Monad takes commercially reasonable measures to secure the Service and protect your data and credentials. This includes using industry-standard security practices, encryption, and access controls. However, no system is 100% secure, and you understand that the Service being a beta may not have been fully tested against all security threats. You use the Service at your own risk with respect to data security. Monad is not liable for any unauthorized access to your data or accounts, or any alteration, deletion, destruction, or loss of your data, except to the extent directly caused by Monad’s intentional breach of this Agreement. You are encouraged to maintain backups of any important data that is processed through the Service, and to verify that data delivered to your chosen destination is intact. Monad does not provide backup or archival services for your log data as part of this Beta.



Third-Party Services and Dependencies

The Service may integrate with or rely on third-party services and software that are not operated by Monad. These third-party elements include, for example, Stripe for payment processing, Segment and Mixpanel for user analytics and debugging, and various external APIs or data services from which you retrieve data or to which you send data via the Service. This section clarifies that those third-party services have their own terms and responsibilities:

- Third-Party Terms Apply: Stripe, Segment, Mixpanel & Others: If you use a paid tier, your payment transactions are processed through Stripe, and your use of Stripe is subject to your agreement with Stripe. Likewise, Monad uses third-party tools such as Segment and Mixpanel to help monitor how users interact with the product and to assist in debugging and improving the Service. If the Service also connects to additional third-party data sources or destinations (e.g., cloud provider APIs, SIEM platforms), your use of those services is subject to your agreements with those third parties. You are solely responsible for complying with any applicable third-party terms of service or license agreements. Monad does not make any guarantees or assume responsibility for the policies, performance, or behavior of third-party providers.  


- No Control or Endorsement: Monad does not control third-party services or websites that may be integrated with the Service. Monad’s inclusion of such integrations or the ability to connect to such services is provided for your convenience and does not constitute an endorsement or warranty of any kind. Monad is not responsible for the contents, operation, or any aspect of third-party services, and shall not be liable for any issues, losses, or damages arising from your use of third-party services. This includes, but is not limited to, data accuracy, data loss, security breaches, or service interruptions caused by the third-party service.  

- Changes to Third-Party Services: Third-party services may change or be updated, and those changes may affect how the Service operates (for example, a third-party API endpoint might be modified or deprecated). Monad is not responsible for such changes, but will attempt to adapt the Service to maintain compatibility where feasible. However, Monad cannot guarantee continuous compatibility with every third-party service, especially during the beta period.  

- Third-Party Software Components: The Service may include software components developed by third parties (including open-source software libraries). All such components are the property of their respective owners and may be distributed to you subject to licenses separate from this Agreement. Where required by those licenses, Monad will make the relevant license terms available to you. Nothing in this Agreement limits your rights under the license terms of any open-source or third-party software included in the Service, and nothing in those third-party licenses expands your rights to use the Service beyond what is stated in this Agreement.  

By agreeing to this EULA, you also agree that Monad has no liability with respect to any third-party services or components, and that your sole remedy for issues or failures arising from third-party services is subject to whatever terms you have with that third party (if any).



Intellectual Property Rights

Monad’s Intellectual Property: The Service (including all software code, databases, algorithms, user interface design, know-how, and documentation) and all improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the Service are and shall remain the intellectual property of Monad or its licensors. All content provided by Monad as part of the Service, such as logos, graphics, and text, are protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Monad retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service and such content, including all related copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights. No rights are granted to you hereunder other than the limited license to use the Service as expressly set forth in this Agreement. You shall not remove or alter any proprietary markings (like copyright or trademark symbols) on the Service or any output of the Service.

Your Data and Intellectual Property: You retain all rights to your own intellectual property and data that you use in connection with the Service. Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of your User Data or any of your intellectual property to Monad. You grant Monad a limited license to handle your User Data only as necessary to provide the Service – for example, to copy, transmit, and process your data in order to deliver it to the destination you’ve configured, and to store it transiently as needed for that purpose. This license also allows Monad to use and display your data to you (and those you authorize) via the Service’s interface. Monad will not use your User Data for any other purposes except as permitted in the Privacy Policy or as required by law. Please ensure that you have the rights necessary to provide any data or content to the Service, and that doing so (and allowing Monad to process it) will not violate any laws or infringe any rights of others.

Feedback License: As mentioned under Beta Product Acknowledgment, any Feedback you choose to provide to Monad (such as suggestions, bug reports, or feature ideas) is entirely voluntary. You agree that Monad will be free to use any Feedback you provide for any purpose. Monad may incorporate the Feedback into the Service or other products without any obligation to you. To the extent your Feedback is protectable under intellectual property laws, you hereby grant Monad a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use, modify, publish, distribute, and create derivative works from the Feedback as it sees fit, without any obligation of confidentiality, attribution, or compensation to you.

Trademarks: The name "Monad", the Monad logo, and any other trademarks, service marks, or trade names of Monad that appear in the Service or related materials are the property of Monad or its affiliates. This Agreement does not grant you any rights to use any Monad trademarks. Likewise, any third-party names or logos that appear in the Service are the property of their respective owners, and nothing in this Agreement grants you rights to use them. You may not remove or alter any trademarks or logos that appear within the Service. Any permitted use of Monad’s trademarks must be in compliance with Monad’s brand guidelines and with prior written permission.



Compliance with Laws and Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Without limiting the restrictions already provided above, you specifically agree to the following:

- Compliance with All Laws: You will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your use of the Service, including local laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside or in which your organization is located. This includes, but is not limited to, laws related to data privacy and protection, intellectual property, export control, and import regulations. If any data you transmit through the Service is subject to special legal protection (for example, personal data under GDPR, or healthcare data under HIPAA in the U.S.), you are responsible for ensuring that use of the Service is permitted under those laws (noting again that the Service is not intended for production use or highly sensitive data in this beta phase).  

- Prohibited Content and Activities: You will not use the Service to upload, transmit, or store any content that is illegal, harmful, obscene, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. This includes content that violates any third-party rights, such as intellectual property rights or privacy/publicity rights. You will not use the Service to engage in fraudulent or malicious activities, such as phishing, distributing malware, or stalking/harassing others.  


- No Unauthorized Access or Abuse: You shall not attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the Service or its related systems or networks. You will not use the Service in a manner that disrupts or impairs the normal operation or integrity of the Service or any networks connected to the Service (e.g., you agree not to launch any denial-of-service attacks, or use the Service in an automated manner that overwhelms it with requests). You will not misuse any interfaces to the Service (such as APIs) by calling them in a manner outside the documented use cases.  

- Export Controls and Sanctions: You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or region that is subject to a government embargo (for example, as of this writing, certain countries may be embargoed by the United States, or other jurisdictions) and that you are not on any government-issued list of prohibited or restricted parties. If U.S. or other national export laws apply to software and technical data, you agree that you will not export or re-export any part of the Service or any data or software received via the Service into any restricted countries or to any restricted persons without the necessary export licenses and approvals.  

- Age and Capacity: You affirm that you are of legal age and have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement. The Service is not directed to children. If you are an individual using the Service, you must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) or have valid authorization from a parent or guardian to use the Service and accept this Agreement.  

Monad reserves the right to investigate any violation of this Agreement or misuse of the Service. Monad may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate the law. Your compliance with the above provisions is a condition of your license to use the Service, and any breach may result in suspension or termination of your access as provided below.



Term and Termination

Term of Agreement: This Agreement will start on the date you first accept it (for instance, by clicking "I agree" or by using the Service, indicating your acceptance) and will continue in effect until terminated as described in this section. Because this is a Beta service, it is expected that this Agreement will at minimum last through the Beta period as defined by Monad. Monad may decide to end the Beta program at any time, which would also terminate this Agreement (or require you to accept a new agreement for any successor non-beta service).

Your Right to Terminate: You have the right to terminate this Agreement at any time by discontinuing all use of the Service. You may cease using the Service and close your account (if one exists). If you are on a paid subscription, you should also cancel your subscription to avoid further billing (as described in the Fees section). Termination of this Agreement by you will not entitle you to any refund of fees already paid (unless explicitly provided by Monad or required by law) and will not relieve you of any obligation to pay outstanding fees or charges.

Monad’s Right to Terminate or Suspend: Monad may suspend or terminate your access to the Service (in whole or in part) or terminate this Agreement at any time at its sole discretion, with or without cause. Reasons we might terminate or suspend your access include, but are not limited to: (a) your breach of any provision of this Agreement or violation of any law or regulation; (b) your use of the Service in a manner that could cause harm to Monad, other users, or third parties (for example, using the Service in a way that impacts system stability or security); (c) our decision to end the Beta program or to discontinue the Service (or any part of it); or (d) unforeseen technical or security issues. We will try to provide advance notice to you in the event of termination or significant suspension when feasible, but you acknowledge that Monad may do so immediately without notice in some circumstances (for instance, if you are in serious violation of the use restrictions or if required by law or due to security emergencies).

Effect of Termination: Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason:

- Cease Use: You must immediately stop using the Service and destroy any locally cached or downloaded components of the Service in your possession (if any).  

- Data and Account: Monad may disable your account and you will lose access to the Service, including any configurations or settings you have stored in the Service. Because Monad does not retain your log data (beyond transient processing) as explained above, there should be no user log data on Monad systems to return to you; any remaining incidental data (like account profile information) will be handled per the Privacy Policy. Monad may delete any of your stored account information after termination, except to the extent retention is required for legal compliance or Monad’s legitimate business purposes.  

- No Liability for Termination: You agree that Monad will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of your access to the Service or deletion of your data, provided that Monad complies with the data handling commitments in this Agreement. Termination of the Service means you may need to seek alternative methods to achieve the data ETL functionality; Monad is not responsible for any costs or damages arising from such termination.  

- Surviving Provisions: Any provision of this Agreement that by its nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to: Disclaimers of Warranty, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law, and Intellectual Property provisions (especially Monad’s rights in Feedback and user obligations regarding use of Service).  

Termination is not an exclusive remedy, and Monad reserves all other rights and remedies available under law or in equity for any violation of this Agreement.



Disclaimers of Warranty

As-Is, With All Faults: The Service is provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis without any warranty of any kind. You acknowledge that the Service is a pre-release Beta and may have inherent defects and limitations. Your use of the Service is at your own risk. Monad, on behalf of itself and its affiliates and licensors, expressly disclaims all warranties and conditions, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to:

- Implied Warranties: All implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. You have the sole responsibility for determining that the Service meets your needs and is suitable for the purposes for which it is used.  

- Accuracy and Reliability: Monad does not warrant that the Service will be accurate, reliable, or secure, or that it will meet your expectations. No information or advice obtained from Monad or through the Service (including via support channels) shall create any warranty not expressly stated in this Agreement.  

- Quality and Performance: Monad makes no warranty that the Service will function without interruption, delay, or errors. You may experience periods of downtime or data inaccuracies. Monad does not warrant that any data transmitted through the Service will be delivered, stored, or processed without loss or corruption.  

- Correction of Issues: There is no guarantee that any defects or errors in the Service will be detected or corrected. While Monad may provide updates during the Beta, it has no obligation to do so or to continue providing the Service.  

- System Compatibility: Monad does not warrant that the Service will be compatible with your systems, integrate with any particular third-party service (other than as explicitly documented), or work within any specific infrastructure or environment. Beta features may not be fully tested across all scenarios.  

Beta-Specific Considerations: You acknowledge that you have been informed that the Service is a Beta release, and as such, you should not rely on it for any purpose where its failure or inaccuracy could lead to damage or loss. For example, do not use the Service as the sole mechanism for critical data retention or real-time alerting for security events. Monad disclaims any liability for any damages or losses arising from the use of the Service in any high-risk or important environment. (For instance, Monad shall not be liable if the Service fails to transfer logs during a security incident, resulting in missed alerts or analysis.)

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so the above disclaimers may not fully apply to you. In such cases, any implied warranties are limited to the minimum duration and scope permitted by law. To the extent this Service is provided for free in the Beta, any statutory warranties that cannot be disclaimed are, to the extent permitted by law, limited in duration to thirty (30) days from your first use of the Service.



Limitation of Liability

Exclusion of Certain Damages: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Monad and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, and licensors shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with the Service or this Agreement. This exclusion includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits or revenues, lost savings, lost data, loss of use, business interruption, procurement of substitute services, or any other intangible losses, even if Monad has been advised of the possibility of such damages. These limitations apply whether the claim is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory.

Limitation of Aggregate Liability: To the extent that liability is not otherwise excluded by this Agreement, and even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose, the total liability of Monad (and its affiliates and licensors) for any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Service shall not exceed the greater of: (a) the total amount of fees you paid to Monad for the Service in the six (6) months immediately prior to the event giving rise to the claim (if you are on a paid tier), or (b) US $100 (one hundred U.S. dollars). If you are using the Service on the free tier without charge, Monad’s total liability to you for any claim shall not exceed US $100. This limitation is cumulative and not per-incident; multiple claims will not increase the cap.

Basis of the Bargain: You agree that the disclaimers and limitations of liability in this Agreement reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and Monad. This Beta is provided at low or no cost in part because of these limitations. You also agree that these limitations form an essential basis of the bargain between you and Monad, and that Monad would not be able to offer the Service without such limitations.

Exceptions: Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded under law (for example, certain liabilities for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or personal injury may not be allowed to be limited by law). However, in any case, Monad’s liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.



Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Monad and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, suits, or proceedings, and all related liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Service (other than claims for which Monad is expressly responsible under this Agreement); (b) your breach or violation of any term of this Agreement or of any applicable law or regulation; or (c) your infringement or violation of any rights of a third party (for example, your provision of data to the Service that infringes someone’s intellectual property rights or violates privacy rights).

Monad reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that case, you agree to cooperate with Monad’s defense of that claim and you may not settle any such claim without Monad’s prior written consent. Your indemnification obligations under this section will survive the termination of this Agreement and your use of the Service.



Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

Governing Law: This Agreement, and any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Service, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different jurisdiction. You acknowledge that the Service is being provided by an entity based in Delaware, and that this choice of law provision is intended to provide predictability in the interpretation of the Agreement.

Jurisdiction and Venue: You and Monad agree that any legal action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in Delaware. Each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. You and Monad waive any objections to the convenience of this forum, even if you reside or are based in another country. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Monad shall be allowed to seek injunctive or equitable relief (such as a court order to protect intellectual property or confidential information) in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Waiver of Jury Trial: To the extent permitted by law, both you and Monad waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service. This provision is knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally waiv­ing rights that each party may have to a jury trial.

No Class Actions: To the extent permitted by law, you and Monad agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.



General Provisions

Entire Agreement: This Agreement (EULA) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Monad with respect to the Service during the Beta period. It supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or representations, whether written or oral, concerning its subject matter. In entering into this Agreement, neither party has relied on any statement or representation not expressly set out herein. (For clarity, if Monad has a separate Terms of Service or other agreement on its website, those do not apply to your use of the Beta Service unless Monad expressly states otherwise. This Beta EULA is self-contained for this Beta offering.)

Changes to this Agreement: Monad may revise or update this Agreement from time to time, especially as the Beta evolves. If we make material changes, we will notify you by posting the updated Agreement on our website or within the Service, or by sending you an email to the address associated with your account. The updated Agreement will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Service after a revised Agreement has been posted or communicated to you indicates your acceptance of the revised terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Service and (if applicable) cancel your subscription. Except as described in this paragraph, this Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

No Waiver: No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall operate or be deemed as a waiver of that or any other right or remedy. Similarly, a single or partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement does not prevent further exercise of that or any other right. Any waiver of a breach of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party granting the waiver, and such waiver will not operate as a waiver of any other breach.

Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The parties will, in good faith, negotiate a valid and enforceable provision that is as similar as possible to the provision that was held invalid or unenforceable, to reflect the original intent.

Assignment: You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (in whole or in part), nor delegate any of your obligations, to any other person or entity without Monad’s prior written consent. Any attempted assignment by you without consent will be null and void. Monad may assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets related to the Service, without your consent. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns.

No Third-Party Beneficiaries: This Agreement is solely for the benefit of you and Monad. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, it is not intended to confer any rights or remedies on any third party. For example, even though Monad’s affiliates and licensors are protected by this Agreement’s disclaimers and limitations, they are not parties to this Agreement and have no obligations under it. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

Relationship of the Parties: The relationship between you and Monad is that of independent contractors. This Agreement does not create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the parties. You have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on Monad’s behalf, and you agree not to represent yourself as an agent or representative of Monad.

Force Majeure: Monad will not be liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations under this Agreement if such failure or delay is caused by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, pandemics, governmental restrictions, strikes, network or telecommunications failures, or power outages.

Notices: Monad may send you notices relating to this Agreement or the Service by email to the address registered with your account, via a notification within the Service, or via certified mail to any address you provided. You must send any notices to Monad by email at the contact address provided below or by recognized international courier or registered mail to Monad’s registered address (attention: Legal Department). Notices will be deemed given (a) in the case of email, when the email is sent (without receiving a bounce-back error), or (b) in the case of physical mail, upon receipt as indicated by courier records or postal return receipt.

Contact Information: If you have any questions or concerns about this EULA or the Service, you may contact Monad at support@monad.com (or another designated support contact provided in the Service or on our website). We will do our best to address your inquiry.
